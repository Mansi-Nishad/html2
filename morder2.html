    <p>

        1. Semantic Elements:
           - Introduces new semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc., making it easier to structure and understand the content of a web page.
        
        2. Audio and Video Support:
           - Native support for embedding audio and video elements with `<audio>` and `<video>` tags, reducing the reliance on third-party plugins like Flash.
        
        3. Canvas:
           - Introduces the `<canvas>` element, allowing dynamic rendering of graphics, charts, and other visualizations directly within the browser using JavaScript.
        
        4. Local Storage:
           - Provides a new client-side storage mechanism called Web Storage, including `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, allowing websites to store data locally on the user's device.
        
        5. Offline Web Applications:
           - Introduces the Application Cache (AppCache) and Service Workers, enabling developers to create offline web applications that can work without an internet connection.
        
        6. Geolocation
           - Includes the Geolocation API, allowing web applications to access the user's location information if the user grants permission.
        
        7. Form Enhancements:
           - Adds new input types (`date`, `email`, `number`, `range`, `tel`, `url`, etc.) and attributes to enhance form controls and improve user experience.
        
        8. WebSockets:
           - Introduces the WebSocket API, enabling real-time communication between the browser and the server over a single, long-lived connection.
        
        9. Web Workers:
           - Allows developers to run scripts in the background using Web Workers, improving performance and responsiveness by offloading tasks from the main thread.
        
        10. Responsive Design:
            - HTML5 encourages the use of responsive web design techniques to create websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
        
        11. Drag and Drop:
            - Adds native support for drag-and-drop interactions, making it easier to implement intuitive interfaces for users to interact with elements.
        
        12. Improved Accessibility:
            - Introduces several features to enhance accessibility, such as the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements for better image and caption associations.
        
        13. New Structural Elements:
            - Introduces new structural elements like `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<mark>`, `<progress>`, and `<time>` for improved document structure and semantics.
        
        14. Enhanced CSS Support:
